The Grid has landed.

So I jumped on board with a start-up (seems like a long time ago) and the time has finally come and they have let me unleash some content on what I guess can be called a new way of thinking about a CMS or even a blog (remember those?). 

The design, layout and other visuals take a more dynamic approach so you can focus in the content.

This may mean a bit more content coming out of me (I haven't blogged in years) and if all goes well some of my business oriented content may move here. 

Let the ride begin!
